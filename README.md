# diffusion-model-indian-landmarks
This repository contains a Stable Diffusion-based generative model that creates images of a silver Mahindra XUV 700 SUV in front of famous Indian landmarks. The model was fine-tuned with prompt engineering to ensure the car remains consistent and the backgrounds are realistic.

Features:

Generates photorealistic images of the SUV at different locations and angles.

Works with landmarks like Bandra-Worli Sea Link (Mumbai), Hawa Mahal (Jaipur), Nagpur Rainforest.

Outputs are organized in separate folders per location for easy review.

Fully implemented using Hugging Face diffusers and SDXL Base.
